Some are born and raised in a family of artists and automatically follow in the footsteps of their parents. Others fall into this environment by the greatest of hazards and sometimes prove to be excellent artists. This is the case of Fetra Arivony, now known as Arione Joy.

He does not come from a family of artists. His father is not a known and recognized musician. Her mother is not a famous singer either. In his childhood or adolescence, he was not part of a choir. Arione Joy, before 2005, was everyone and had no ambition to become an artist in his youth. The artistic milieu, he falls into it by chance. In 2005, he met a rapper who asked him to appear in his clip. "He asked me if I could rap." It was his first experience. Four years later, he was a member of a hip hop group: TMC. He continues his race and switches to reggae roots. With MC Lion, he even released a single "neny". 2011, he left Antsirabe to settle in the Capital. For Arivony, this is the start of a new and beautiful adventure. That year, he joined the Mafianar Entertainment team, not as an artist but as a staff member.

Simple. It was not until the end of 2014 that the young man signed with Mafianar. The following year, "voninkazo voarara" was broadcast on all channels and had, for weeks, been first in Madagascan hits. Arione Joy comes out of anonymity. The young singer is even approached by many producers and event organizers. Fame has not changed Arivony, which has remained the same as before. "If I want to eat in the local tavern for a delicious" anana sy henakisoa ", I'll go. If I want to take the bus, I take a seat. It's Wednesday, I want to take a trip to Andravoahangy, I can't help it. I do not take the lead and do not take myself for a star ”. Arione Joy, although he has remained as simple as before, however intends to climb the steps. After the release, a few weeks ago, "Za sy ny malaso", an album composed of 15 tracks, Arione Joy plans to release another clip: "Cinderella" in June. A song that follows the same line as "Voankazo voarara" and which, we wish, will be as successful as his first big hit.
